# Sprint-4-Project
# Random Events Simulation Tool for Vehicles

This project aims to explore the world of vehicles through data analysis. Below, we describe the key steps and the tools used:

## Project Description

This is a **random events simulation tool** related to vehicles. Through data analysis, we investigate various aspects of cars, including their condition, price, and mileage. The project is divided into the following stages:

1. **Data Cleaning**: We prepare the data for analysis by handling outliers, missing values, and duplicates.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**: We explore the relationship between car condition and quantity. Additionally, we examine how condition impacts vehicle prices.

3. **Average Mileage Calculation**: We calculate the average mileage for each car model type.

## Methods and Libraries Used

To perform this analysis, we utilize the following Python libraries:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Streamlit**: To create an interactive interface and visualize results.
- **Plotly and Altair**: For generating charts and visualizations.

## Instructions for Running the Project Locally

1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure you have Python and the mentioned libraries installed.
3. Run the main file (e.g., `main.py`) in your local environment.
4. Open your web browser and access the local address provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Online Access

You can also access the project online via Render.

Explore the data and enjoy analyzing the world of vehicles! üöóüîç
